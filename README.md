# Ticket Generator App

This is a ticket generator app as a fullfilment of the challenge on Frontend Mentor: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/conference-ticket-generator-oq5gFIU12w. The difficulty level is Junior but it gave me an opportunity to a few new things.

## Stack
* HTML
* CSS/SCSS
* Java Script

## Notes
In this project much of my focus was on learning the use of sass/scss, so i did not foucus much on every detail however i did learn alot:
* using regex for form validation
* sharing information across pages using session storage
* using file reader to load files from the user into my app...
